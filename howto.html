          If this is your first time participating in
          <strong>Code-a-Pookkalam</strong>, welcome! Don't worry if you're new
          to coding or unsure about how to create your own Pookkalam using code
          - we're here to help. This guide will walk you through the basics and
          get you started.

        <h2>üé® Use Any Language or Platform</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In Code-a-Pookkalam, you are free to use any programming language or
          platform that you are comfortable with to design your Pookkalam.
          However, if you are a beginner, we recommend starting with one of
          these two beginner-friendly options:
        </p>

        <h3>1. p5.js (JavaScript)</h3>
        <p>
          p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create graphics
          and interactive visuals in your browser. It's an excellent choice for
          beginners because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can see the output immediately in your browser.</li>
          <li>The syntax is simple and beginner-friendly.</li>
          <li>It's highly versatile and can be used for creative coding.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why p5.js?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Beginner-friendly ‚Äî you can start with no coding experience. üöÄ
          </li>
          <li>
            You can run your code directly in the browser ‚Äî no need to install
            anything! üåê
          </li>
          <li>Tons of resources to help you along the way. üìö</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Started with p5.js</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Visit the p5.js Website:</strong><br />
          Go to the
          <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js website</a> to get
          familiar with what it is and explore its possibilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Learn with Tutorials:</strong><br />
          Head over to the
          <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/" target="_blank"
            >p5.js tutorials</a
          >
          to start learning the basics, like drawing shapes, adding colors, and
          more. üñçÔ∏è
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Write Code in the Online Editor:</strong><br />
          You don't need to download any software! You can code directly in the
          browser. Just visit the
          <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank"
            >p5.js online editor</a
          >
          and start coding right away. üíª
        </p>

        <p>Here's a simple example to get you started:</p>
        <pre><code>function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);  // Set the background color to white
  ellipse(200, 200, 150, 150);  // Draw a circle
}</code></pre>

        <h3>2. Python Turtle</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Python Turtle?</strong><br />
          Python Turtle is another beginner-friendly way to create graphics with
          code. You can use simple commands to make a virtual "turtle" move
          around the screen and draw shapes, making it perfect for designing
          pookalam patterns.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why Python Turtle?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Very simple to learn ‚Äî you can start drawing with just a few lines
            of code. ‚ú®
          </li>
          <li>
            It's fun and visual, making it ideal for creative projects like
            this. üé®
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Getting Started with Python Turtle</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Use the Python Turtle Online Editor:</strong><br />
          No need to install Python on your computer! Just go to the
          <a href="https://pythonsandbox.com/turtle" target="_blank"
            >Python Turtle online editor</a
          >
          and start coding in your browser. üåü
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Learn the Basics with Tutorials:</strong><br />
          If you're new to Python or Turtle, don't worry! Check out the
          <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html"
            target="_blank"
            >Python Turtle tutorial</a
          >
          to get started with the basics. üìò
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Try This Simple Code:</strong><br />
          Here's a small example that draws a circle:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import turtle

pookalam = turtle.Turtle()
pookalam.circle(100)  # Draw a circle with a radius of 100 units
turtle.done()</code></pre>

        <h3>3. Joy</h3>
        <p>
          Joy is a tiny creative coding library in Python, made by FOSS United
          India See how to use Joy:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/fossunited/joy/blob/main/README.md"
            target="_blank"
            >https://github.com/fossunited/joy/blob/main/README.md</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Other Languages</strong><br />
          You are free to use any language that supports graphical output, such
          as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>JavaScript (HTML5 Canvas)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Java (AWT/Swing)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>C++ (Graphics libraries)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Processing</strong></li>
          <li>Or any other platform‚Ä¶</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Choose Your Platform and Let Your Creativity Flow! üé®‚ú®</strong
          ><br />
          Whichever platform you choose ‚Äî p5.js or Python Turtle ‚Äî creating a
          virtual pookalam is all about having fun and letting your creativity
          flow. Don't worry if you're a beginner; both platforms are designed to
          be easy to use, and there are plenty of resources to guide you along
          the way.
        </p>

        <p>Good luck, and we can't wait to see your pookalams! üå∏üöÄ</p>
